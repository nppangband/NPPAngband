/*
 * Memory management routines.
 *
 * Set ralloc_aux to modify the memory allocation routine.
 * Set rnfree_aux to modify the memory de-allocation routine.
 * Set rpanic_aux to let the program react to memory failures.
 *
 * These routines work best as a *replacement* for malloc/free.
 *
 * The string_make() and string_free() routines handle dynamic strings.
 * A dynamic string is a string allocated at run-time, which should not
 * be modified once it has been created.
 *
 * Note the macros below which simplify the details of allocation,
 * deallocation, setting, clearing, casting, size extraction, etc.
 *
 * The macros MAKE/C_MAKE and KILL have a "procedural" metaphor,
 * and they actually modify their arguments.
 *
 * Note that, for some reason, some allocation macros may disallow
 * "stars" in type names, but you can use typedefs to circumvent
 * this.  For example, instead of "type **p; MAKE(p,type*);" you
 * can use "typedef type *type_ptr; type_ptr *p; MAKE(p,type_ptr)".
 *
 * Note that it is assumed that "memset()" will function correctly,
 * in particular, that it returns its first argument.
