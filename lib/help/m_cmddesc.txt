====== Basic Command Information ======

Canceling a Command:
     Virtually all commands can be canceled at any point before execution by hitting the ESC key.

Command Counts:
     Any command that can be repeated, or that can manipulate more than one object, can take a count.  By default, most that do are automatically given a count of 99.  Although most commands that usually need a quantity will ask for one, for other commands a quantity is only sometimes desired.  Hence command counts.  For example, to tunnel into a wall exactly 50 times, you would type a zero ("0"), then "50", followed by a return.  Then use the tunnel command.  All commands that use quantities will stop if you are disturbed, accomplish your intended task, hit any key, or when the count expires.

Doing More with Less Effort:
     The section on making macros describes how to:
     - quickly switch to a shovel or backup weapon,
     - fire a missile or cast commonly used spells with a single keystroke,
     - prevent accidental use of valuable equipment,
     - and many other things

Interfaces:
     See the "interfaces" section for more details about powerful and complex commands.



====== Command Descriptions ======

     Command names are followed by one or two characters:  the first is that used in the original keyset; the second, that used in the roguelike keyset (if different).


--- Movement Commands ---

Stay still -- with normal pickup (,) / (.) :
     Stay in the same square for one move.  If you normally pick up objects you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on.  You may also use the "5" key (both keysets).  This command takes a full turn.

Walk -- with normal pickup (;) :
     This command activates every time you press a direction key; it moves you one step in the given direction.  This command takes a full turn.

Walk -- flip pickup (-) :
     Walk.  If you normally pick things up, don't.  Otherwise, do.  This command takes a full turn.

Run (.) / (,) :
     This command is very useful for rapid dungeon exploration.  It will move you in the given direction, following any bends in the corridor, until you either have to make a choice between two directions or are disturbed.  Most players run by holding down Shift and pressing a direction key.

Go up staircase (<) :
     Ascend an up staircase.  Going up a staircase will take you to a new dungeon level unless you are at 50 feet (level 1), in which case you will return to the town.  This command takes a full turn.


Go down staircase (>) :
     Descend a down staircase.  Going down a staircase will take you to a new dungeon level.  This command takes a full turn.

--- Object Commands ---

Inventory list (i) :
     Display a list of objects in your backpack.

Equipment list (e) :
     Display a list of objects you are currently wielding, wearing, or otherwise have immediately to hand.

Drop an item (d) :
     Drop an item from your inventory or equipment onto the floor.  If the grid you are standing on has objects in it already, or cannot hold objects, the object will end up nearby.  Be warned that if the floor is very full, and you attempt to drop something, it may disappear and be destroyed.  This command takes half a turn.

Destroy an item (k) / (Ctrl-D) :
     Destroy an object in your inventory or on the dungeon floor.  If the "verify destroy" option is ON, you must verify this command.  This command takes a full turn, and also gives you an option to squelch all of these object types in the future.

Wear/Wield equipment (w) :
     Wear or wield an object in your inventory or from the floor.  Since only one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield an item into a slot that is already occupied, the old item will first be taken off.  If there is no room in your inventory, it drops to the floor.  This command takes a full turn.

Take off equipment (t) / (T) :
     Take off a (uncursed) piece of equipment and return it to your inventory.  If there is no room in your inventory for the item, your pack will overflow and you will drop the item after taking it off.  This command takes half a turn.

Switch primary and secondary weapon (X) :
     Exchange whatever weapon you have wielded with the weapon in your the secondary weapon slot.  This command takes a half turn.

Inscribe an object ({) :
     Inscribe an object.  The inscription appears inside curly braces after the object description.  The inscription is limited to the particular object (or pile) and is not automatically transferred to all similar objects, unless the "Merge Inscriptions when Stacking" option is on.

Uninscribe an object (}) :
     Remove the inscription on an object.  This command will have no effect on inscriptions added by the game itself (such as "{cursed}").


--- Object Usage Commands ---

Eat some food (E) :
     Eat some food or a mushroom.  This command takes a full turn.

Fuel your lantern/torch (F) :
     You can refuel lanterns with flasks of oil and torches with other torches. In general, two flasks will fully fuel a lantern and two torches will fully fuel a torch.  This command takes half a turn.

Quaff a potion (q) :
     Drink a potion.  This command takes a full turn.

Read a scroll (r) :
     Read a scroll.  Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be aborted (by pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll before it disintegrates.  This command takes a full turn.

Activate an object (A) :
     You have heard rumours of special wearable items deep in the MinesShould you ever be lucky enough to find such an item, this command will let you activate its special power.  This command takes a full turn.

Aim a wand (a) / (z) :
Use a staff (u) / (Z) :

     Uses the indicated kind of magical device.  This command takes a full turn.

Object menu (|)
     This interactive menu lets the player go through the objects in the player's inventory, equipment, and on the floor and select from a menu of allowable commands for that item.


--- Dungeon and Object Alteration Commands ---

Tunnel (T) / (Ctrl-T) :
     Dig through barriers, mine treasure found in wall seams, and otherwise alter the dungeon to your liking.  This command may take a count and requires a full turn.  This command also makes alot of noise.

Open a door or chest (o) :
     Open a door or chest.  If locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based on your disarming ability.  If you open a trapped chest without disarming the traps first, they will activate.  Some doors will be jammed shut and may have to be bashed open.  This command takes a full turn.
     You may set the "easy_open" option to open doors that you walk into.

Close a door (c) :
     Close a door.  Some monsters cannot open doors, so shutting them can be quite useful.  Broken doors cannot be closed.  This command takes a full turn.

Jam a door (j) / (S) :
     Jam a door (so that it needs to be bashed down).  Many monsters can simply open closed doors, and can eventually get through a locked door.  You may therefore occasionally want to jam a door shut with iron spikes.  Each spike used on the door will make it harder to bash down the door, up to a limit of eight.  This command takes a full turn.

Bash a door or Monster (B) / (f) :
     Bash down jammed doors.  Your door bashing ability increases with strength.  Bashing open a door can (briefly) throw you off balance and sometimes ruins the door.  All doors can be bashed; jammed or spiked doors will not open any other way.  Bashing a monster can damage the monster and paralyze it for a half turn, however if the player misses, he can be paralyzed for 3-4 turns.

This command takes a full turn.

Disarm a trap or chest (D) :
     You can attempt to disarm known traps on the floor or on chests.  If you fail, there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off.  This command takes a full turn.

Alter (+) :
     This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select any of the dungeon alteration commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open, disarm, close), and, by using macros or keymaps, to combine this keypress with directions.  This command takes a full turn.  

Get objects off of the dungeon floor ('g') :
     Sort through and pick up selected objects off the floor grid the player is standing on, regardless of squelch settings or the order of items on the floor.  This command takes no time.

--- Special Action Commands ---

Rest (R) :
     You recover from wounds twice as quickly by resting than by repeatedly staying still.  This command can be told to stop automatically after a certain amount of time, or when various conditions are met.  In either case, you always wake up when anything disturbs you, or when you press any key.
     After typing 'R', use "*" to rest until your hitpoints and mana are restored, and "&" to rest until you are fully "healed".  This command may accept a command count (used for the number of turns to rest), and takes a full turn.

Search (s) :
     Search for hidden traps and secret doors adjacent to you.  More than a single turn of searching will be required in most cases.  This command can take a count, which is useful if you are confident of finding something eventually, since the command stops as soon as anything is found.  This command takes a full turn.

Turn searching mode on and off (S) :
     In searching mode, you search every time you move.  You therefore move more slowly.  Search mode will automatically turn off if you are disturbed.

Look around (l) / (x) :
     Look around at nearby monsters (to determine their type, health, and carried objects) and objects (to determine their type).  This command can also be used to find out what objects (if any) are under monsters, what terrain a monster is in, and what is under the character.  See the interfaces section for more information.  This command takes no time.

     You may also use this command to ask about all monsters (type Control-A), unique monsters (Control-U), or non-unique monsters (Control-N).
     This command takes no time.

Full screen map (M) :
     Show a map of the entire dungeon on screen.  Only the major dungeon features will be visible because of the scale, so even some important things may not show up.

--- Special Notes ---

Special Keys:
     Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host machine, causing unexpected results.  In general, these special keys are control keys; often you can disable their special effects.

     It is often possible to specify "control-keys" without actually pressing the control key, by typing a caret ("^") followed by the key.  This is useful for specifying control-key commands that might be caught by the operating system.

     Pressing backslash ("\") before a command will bypass all keymaps, and the next keypress will be interpreted as an underlying command key.  The backslash key is useful for creating macro actions which are not affected by any keymap definitions that may be in force.  For example, the three-character sequence "\.6" will always mean "run east", even if the "." key has been mapped to a different underlying command.

UNIX-specific notes:
     If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-C will interrupt the game.  The second and third interrupt will induce a warning bell, and the fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message, since the fifth will quit the game, after killing your character.  Also, Ctrl-Z will suspend the game, and return you to the original command shell, until you resume the game with the "fg" command.  There is now a compilation option to force the game to
prevent the "double ctrl-z escape death trick".  The Ctrl-\ and Ctrl-D and Ctrl-S keys should not be intercepted.
