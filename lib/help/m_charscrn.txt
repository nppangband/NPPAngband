====== The character screen (in detail) ======

     The character information display allows you to review attributes, change
names, and save character dumps to file.  The save character to file command
saves the character screen, character background, inventory and equipment, skill
levels, and the contents of the home.

     This interface has five modes, which you may cycle through by typing '+/-'.


--- Main character screen ---

First row:
     - Name : character's full name
     - Gender, race, class, class title
     - Hitpoints : current and maximum
     - Spellpoints : current and maximum

     - Max Exp : maximum experience (undrained value)

     - % burden : shows the percentage of your max carrying weight.  
     - Armour : your actual base armour, plus what you think your armour bonus
       is (will be accurate if all of your equipment is identified)
     - Fight : plusses to hit chance and damage, before any weapon bonuses

       any known weapon bonuses.  See the combat section for more on how this
       works.

       including any known weapon bonuses
     - Blows : the number of blows you get with your current melee weapon

     - Speed : your base speed, not counting any temporary effects (temporary 
       hasting or slowing)
     - Infra : how far you can see warm-blooded creatures, even when invisible
       or in darkness

     - Saving Throw : your resistance to magic
     - Stealth : how naturally quiet you are
     - Fighting : your hand-to-hand combat skill (inherent skill, plus bonuses)
     - Shooting : your missile combat skill (inherent skill, plus bonuses)
     - Disarming : your ability to disarm traps and unlock doors
     - Magical Device : your ability to use magical devices and activatable
       items
     - Perception : your ability to find traps and hidden doors automatically
     - Searching : your ability to find traps and hidden doors by searching for
       them

     Descriptions of abilities can be quantified in numbers, or can go from 
very bad -> bad -> poor -> fair -> good -> very good -> excellent -> superb ->
heroic -> legendary.


--- Attributes screen ---

     Press '+/-', and your character screens display attributes of known
(identified) equipped objects, and objects stored in the home, shown under 
the same indexes that are used when displaying your equipment.  The '@' lists 
attributes and modifiers that you possess intrinsically.  If you are an Elf, 
for example, you will always resist light.

Vital Statistics:
     The top-center of this display lists modifiers to stats.  They are light
green if the object does not also sustain that stat and green if it does.  If
the object sustains a stat without affecting it, a green 's' is displayed.  
Because character dumps in not in color, the stat sustains are displayed
in a separated chart from the modifiers.

Attributes:
     The bottom of the screen displays most other non-combat attributes.  Blue
'+' and green '*'s indicate the presence of the attribute.
     - Acid  : plus = resist acid
     - Elec  : plus = resist electricity
     - Fire  : plus = resist fire
     - Cold  : plus = resist cold
     - Blind : plus = resist blindness
     - S.Dig : plus = slow digestion
     - Feath : plus = resist
     - PLite : plus = shining object.  +1 to total light radius
     - Regen : plus = faster regeneration of hitpoints and mana
     - Telep : plus = telepathy (see all nearby monsters with minds)
     - Invis : plus = see invisible
     - FrAct : plus = free action (no paralyzation, protection against slowing)
     - HLife : plus = hold life (you lose less to drain-exp attacks)
     - Stea. : plus = affects stealth
     - Sear. : plus = affects searching
     - Aggr. : plus = equipment aggravates creatures in the dungeon
     - Speed : plus = affects speed
     - Blows : plus = affects the number of melee blows you get
     - Shots : plus = affects the speed at which you fire missiles
     - Might : plus = increases your missile weapon damage multiplier

The fifth mode tells you any temporary spell effects you 
may be under (such as being temporarily resistant to 
fire, cold, etc...).
