====== Options ======

Various concepts mentioned below:
     "disturb"    : cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands
     "flush"      : forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue,
                    including any macros in progress
     "fresh"      : dump any pending output to the screen

Options you may want to change to your preferences include:
     - Roguelike commands, if you are used to the commands used in certain other
       roguelike games, or have no number pad.
     - Checking that the hitpoint warning is non-zero can save your character's
       life.
     - Set the delay factor to two or more, and turn ON "fresh_before", if you
       want to see pretty ball explosions and whatnot.
     - Playing around with the lighting options in the Display Options section
       can be a lot of fun.

Saving options:
     Options are saved in your character's savefile, but you may want to use the
same options for other characters too.  Whenever you save options, you have
essentially four choices of filenames:
     - <<savefile name>>.prf  : affects only that character
     - <<race name>>.prf      : affects all characters of that race
     - <<class name>>.prf     : affects all characters of that class
     - user.prf               : affects all of your characters

     These rules also apply to other kinds of preferences.


--- Option Set #1:  User Interface ---
***** <use_sound>
Use sound                                         [use_sound]       (off) :
     Turns on and off sound, for the ports that support sound effects.

***** <rogue_like_commands>
Rogue-like commands                           [rogue_like_commands]  (off):
     Selects the "roguelike" command set, which uses eight of the letter keys to
move the character about.  This command set can be really useful if you have no
number pad, and some people just naturally prefer it.  However, the original
command set has considerably more unused keys available for macros and keymaps.

***** <floor_query_flag>
Prompt for floor item selection               [floor_query_flag]     (on):
     If turned on, you will always be prompted to select an item off the floor,
even if there is only one possible choice.  Turning off this option means
if there is only one possible item to select it will be automatically selected.
Note this means a potion could be automatically quaffed if it is the only 
potion on the floor and you select 'q' to quaff, followed by '-' to select
items on the floor.

***** <carry_query_flag>
Prompt before picking things up               [carry_query_flag]     (on) :
    The game gives you a menu of items on the floor to pick up, after
any objects marked for automatic pickup have been picked up.  

***** <use_old_target>
Use old target by default                     [use_old_target]       (off):
     Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the current
target if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous if you target
locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

***** <always_pickup>
Pick things up by default                     [always_pickup]        (on) :
    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it up.
Picking up objects this way takes no additional energy.  Individual objects
can be marked for auto_pickup by inscribing them with '=g'.  This option
can also be overridden by setting an objects squelch setting to NEVER_PICKUP
in either the knowledge or squelch menus.

***** <stack_force_notes>
Merge inscriptions when stacking              [stack_force_notes]    (off):
     Allows objects with and without inscriptions to stack, retaining any
inscription.

***** <stack_force_costs>
Merge discounts when stacking                 [stack_force_costs]    (off):
     Allows objects with greater and lesser discounts to stack, retaining the
larger discount.

***** <auto_display_lists>
Automatically display drop-down lists       [auto_display_lists]   (off)  :  
    If selecting anything from a list, the list will automatically pop up.  Lists
of objects will automatically display when targeting with the (l)ook command.

***** <easy_open>
Open/Disarm/Close without direction           [easy_open]            (off):
     When you issue the open, close, or disarm commands, and there is only one
usable door or visible trap adjacent to you, it is selected automatically.

***** <easy_alter>
Open/Disarm doors/traps on movement           [easy_alter]           (off):
     When you move into a door, you attempt to open it.  When you move into a
trap, you attempt to disarm it.

***** <expand_inscribe>
Expand the power of the inscribe commands     [expand_inscribe]       (on):
     Prompt for automatic addition and removal of inscriptions every time
an object is inscribed.

***** <mouse_movement>
Allow mouse clicks to move the player          [mouse_movement]       (on):  
Player attempts to automatically move to the spot where the player clicks on
the screen.

***** <mouse_buttons>
Show mouse status line buttons                 [mouse_buttons]       (on): 
Show mouse status line buttons on the bottom line of the main screen.       

***** <smart_cheat>
Monsters exploit players weaknesses           [smart_cheat]          (off):
     Monsters instantly know all your resistances, and need spend no time
learning.

***** <xchars_to_file>
Allow accents in output files        [xchars_to_file]      (off)  :  
    Allow non-ascii characters to be saved in output files.


--- Option Set #2:  Display Options ---

***** <hp_changes_color>
Player color indicates low hit points         [hp_changes_color]     (off) :
     As a player's hitpoints drops, the color of the player changes 
as a warning.  90-100% of max hp - White.  70-89% - Yellow.  50-69% -
Orange.  30-49% - Light Red.  Less than 30% of max hp - Red.

***** <hilight_player>
Hilite the player with the cursor             [hilight_player]        (off) :
     Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on some UNIX
terminals, but horrible on most graphics machines.

***** <center_player>
Center map continuously (very slow)           [center_player]        (off) :
     Center the map continuously.  Advantages include removal of the need to
adjust the map panel and less jerky character movement; disadvantages include
not being able to control your field of view and constant map shifting.
Substantially slows down the game.

***** <show_piles>
Show stacks using special attr/char           [show_piles]           (off) :
     Displays a stack of floor objects using a special character.

***** <show_flavors>
Show flavors in object descriptions           [show_flavors]         (on) :
     Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object descriptions and information
screens, even for objects whose type is known.  This does not affect objects in
stores.

***** <view_yellow_light>
Use special colors for torch lite             [view_yellow_light]     (off) :
     If the option "view_special_light" is also on, floor grids that are only
lit by the player's own light source will appear yellow.  If the option
"view_granite_light" is on, walls will be colored in the same way.  Turning this
option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.

***** <view_bright_light>
Use special colors for field of view          [view_bright_lite]     (off) :
     This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable" grids in
 certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite"). When 
this option is set, floor grids which are normally drawn in "white" but 
which are not currently "viewable" by the player are instead drawn in "dark 
gray".  This makes the "viewable" grids to appear "brighter" than the others,
allowing the player to easily determine which floor grids are in "line of 
sight".  Turning this option off will probably increase the speed of the game.

***** <view_granite_light>
Use special colors for wall grids             [view_granite_light]    (off) :
     This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids which
are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally are).  When the 
player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit, we use 
"yellow" (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the
"view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line of sight, or the 
grid is dark, or the grid is only "partially" lit, then we use "gray", 
otherwise we use the normal "white".  Turning this option off will probably 
increase the speed of the game.  This option may not work well if the attr/char
codes for walls/veins have been changed, or if "graphics" are being used.

***** <view_special_light>
Use special colors for floor grids            [view_special_light]    (off) :
     This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids which
are normally drawn in "white" (as they normally are).  When the player is blind, 
we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit, we use "yellow"
(or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the grid
is "dark", we use "dark gray", else if the "view_bright_lite" option is
set, and the grid is not in line of sight, we use "gray", otherwise we
use the normal "white".  Turning this option off will probably increase
the speed of the game.  This option may not work well if the attr/char
codes for walls/veins have been changed, or if "graphics" are being used.

***** <view_perma_grids>
Map remembers all perma-lit grids             [view_perma_grids]     (on) :
     Memorize all permanently lit floor grids.  Turning this option off allows
you to know which lit floor grids are in line of sight.  If you are using color,
however, the "view_bright_lite" option works better.

***** <view_torch_grids>
Map remembers all torch-lit grids             [view_torch_grids]     (off):
     Memorize all floor grids that have ever been lit up by the player.  This is
one way to help keep track of which areas you have explored.

***** <mark_squelch_items>
Items marked for squelch appear as dot        [mark_squelch_items]    (off) :
    Any item that is marked for squelching on the dungeon floor or ground 
appears as a purple dot on-screen, allowing the player to easily ignore that
item.

***** <animate_flicker>
Animate multi-coloured monsters and items   [animate_flicker]    (off)  :
    Certain powerful monsters and items will shimmer in real time, i.e. 
    between keypresses. 

--- Option Set #3:  Warning and disturbance options ---


***** <disturb_move>
Disturb whenever any monster moves            [disturb_move]         (on) :
     Disturb the player when any visible monster moves, appears, or disappears,
whether in line of sight or out of it.  This increases safety, but may cause
trouble when you have telepathy and are trying to rest.

***** <disturb_near>
Disturb whenever viewable monster moves       [disturb_near]         (on) :
     Disturb the player when any viewable (visible and in direct line of sight)
monster moves, whenever any monster becomes viewable, and whenever any viewable
monster becomes no longer viewable.
     It is recommended that you leave this option on; not doing so may cause you
to be ambushed by monsters you can easily see.

***** <disturb_detect>
Disturb whenever leaving trap detected area   [disturb_detect]        (on) :
     Disturbs you when you leave the edge of the area where you have
detected traps.

***** <disturb_state>
Disturb whenever player state changes         [disturb_state]        (on) :
     This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state changes,
including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

***** <quick_messages>
Activate quick messages                       [quick_messages]       (on) :
     Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt.
Allows most keys to mean "no" to any "[y/n]" prompt.  Use of this option can
be dangerous!

***** <auto_more>
Automatically clear '-more-' prompts          [auto_more]            (off):
     The game does not wait for a keypress when it comes to a -more- prompt, but
erases the message instead.  This may speed up play, but can cause you to miss
important warnings or interesting occurrences if you do not have an extra window
devoted to message recall.


***** <ring_bell>
Audible bell (on errors, etc)                 [ring_bell]            (on) :
     Make a bell sound when errors occur (such as typing an invalid key).

***** <flush_failure>
Flush input on various failures               [flush_failure]        (on) :
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
failures occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand, etc.
This is very useful if you use macros that include directional components with
commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from walking towards monsters
when your spells fail.

***** <flush_disturb>
Flush input whenever disturbed                [flush_disturb]        (off):
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
character is disturbed.  This is useful if you use macros that take time, since
it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being attacked by a
monster.

***** <verify_destroy>
Verify destruction of objects                 [verify_destroy]       (on) :
     Gives you an "are you sure" message when you try to destroy an object.

***** <notify_recharge>
Notify on object recharge                     [notify_recharge]      (off) :
     If a rod is inscribed with !!, a message is displayed when it finished
re-charging.


***** <birth_opt_menu>
--- Option Set #4:  Birth ---

     You may only change birth options when starting up a new character.


***** <birth_money>
Adult: Preserve artifacts when leaving level  [adult_money]         (off) :
     The character starts with no equipment, and 500 in gold.

***** <birth_take_notes>
Adult:  Have notes to written to a file       [adult_take_notes]     (off) :
     Character can write notes to a specific file.  In addition, notes
are taken automatically when: a player reaches a character level
divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, etc..), a unique is killed, an artifact is
identified, or a greater vault is found.  The turn, character level, and 
depth of the player are automatically recorded.  This information is 
in character dumps near the bottom.  For artifacts, the level the 
artifact was found is recorded, rather than the level the player
is on when they identify the item.  Also given separate notes are 
player birth, death, and the killing of Morgoth.

***** <birth_ironman>
Ironman Play:
     "Go down into the dungeon.  Return with Morgoth's Crown or not at all."
In Ironman mode, you can never go up any staircase, and can never return to the
surface by any means, until victorious.  If by accident you do, you must
immediately return to the dungeon.
     Some forms of Ironman play require that you visit no stores before going
into the dungeon, or that you must use a down staircase as soon as you see it
("crash-dive ironman"), but they are variants on the basic theme.  There are
certain objects available in ironman mode that are not available in a regular
game.

***** <birth_no_stores>
Adult: Restrict the use of stores/home        [adult_no_stores]      (off) :
     Cannot use any stores or your home.

***** <birth_no_artifacts>
Adult: Restrict creation of artifacts         [adult_no_artifacts]   (off) :
     No artifacts will appear.

***** <birth_no_stacking>
Adult: Don't stack objects on the floor       [adult_no_stacking]    (off) :
     The game normally allows many objects to stack in each floor grid.
However, some people prefer the challenge of allowing only one object to appear
in each floor grid.  Turning this option ON causes objects dropped by monsters
to disappear if space is tight, and therefore encourages you to fight battles in
wide-open spaces.


***** <birth_no_selling>
Adult: No selling items to stores         [birth_no_store_services] (off) :
    If this option is set, items will sell to the stores for 0 gold.  Gold found
in the dungeon will be approximately 5 times the value.


--- Option Set #7:  Cheat ---

***** <cheat_peek>
Peek into object creation                     [cheat_peek]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

***** <cheat_hear>
Peek into monster creation                    [cheat_hear]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at monster creation.

***** <cheat_room>
Peek into dungeon creation                    [cheat_room]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at room creation.

***** <cheat_xtra>
Peek into something else                      [cheat_xtra]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can know when shopkeepers are shuffled, 
dungeon level generation is restarted, or monsters can not be placed.

***** <cheat_know>
Know complete monster info                    [cheat_know]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

***** <cheat_live>
Allow player to avoid death                   [cheat_live]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.


--- Window Options ---

Window Flags:
     Some platforms support multiple windows, which can display all sorts of
useful information.  The best thing about these windows is that they are
(usually) updated automatically to reflect the current state of the world.

     inven/equip:       Display the player inventory (and equipment).
     equip/inven:       Display the player equipment (and inventory).
     player (basic):    Display the main character screen.
     player (extra):    Display the character screen's equipment flags section.
     player (compact):  Display the player information such as name, class, 
                             title, stats, ac, hp and sp.
     view map:          Display the map.
     messages:          Display recent messages and notes.
     overhead view:     Display an overhead view of the dungeon.
     monster recall:    Display a description of the target monster.
     object recall:     Display a description of the most recently selected
                           object.  Currently this only affects spellbooks 
                           and prayerbooks.
     monster list:      Display a list of monsters that are currently viewable 
                            by the player.
     status:            Display player's current status.
     item list:         Display a list of any visible floor objects on the 
                            screen.
     feature recall:    Display a description of the target feature.
  
  

--- Miscellaneous Options ---

***** <squelch>
Item Squelch and Autoinscribe Menus:
     The squelching menu is a place where the player can specify certain items
to be automatically destroyed when walked over.  Each item the player has seen
in the game can be set with one of four squelch or pickup options:

No-Squelch    - This option defers to never_pickup option for whether to pick
                picked up an object or not.  The object is not squelched.
Never Pickup  - The object is not squelched, but this specific item is never 
                picked up regardless of the setting of the never_pickup option.
Always Pickup - The object is not squelched, but this specific item is always 
                picked up regardless of the setting of the never_pickup option.
Squelch       - Squelch the object when the player walks over it.  Artifacts 
                can not be squelched.

Enter Autoinscription - An inscription can be entered for a specific object type.
                Whenever an item is picked up or bought at a store by the player
                this inscription is automatically inscribed on an item.  Note 
                that entering any item auto inscription also prevents this 
                item from a quelity squelch when the item is identified 
                (useful for preserving average maces of disruption when hafted 
                weapons are set to squelch average and below}.

***** <qual_squelch>
Quality squelching sub menu:  Categories of items (shields, swords) can be 
set to automatically be destroyed when either identified or pseudo-identified 
as cursed, average or below, good or below (both strong and weak speugo id).
The option to squelch open chests can also be set at this screen.  
Note that items with an auto inscription are not quality squelched.

***** <ego_squelch>
Ego-item squelching sub-menu: allows the player to set certain ego-items to
always squelch upon identification (ex. the player has little need for a 
shield of resistance after they find their first shield of elvenkind).

***** <delay factor>
Base Delay Factor:
     The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects
used for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks.  The actual time delay is equal
to "delay_factor" squared, in milliseconds.  A value of five works well on many
machines.

***** <hp warning>
Hitpoint warning:
     If non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints (x10) at which you
start to get special warnings.  It is also used as the cut-off for using red to
display both hitpoints and mana.

***** <lazymove>
Movement Delay Factor:
     The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the movement for 
players.
