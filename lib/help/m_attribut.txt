===== Character Attributes ======

--- Basic attributes ---

Experience:
     As you kill monsters, learn about objects by using them, cast spells and
pray prayers for the first time, disarm traps, and unlock doors (listed in
descending order of importance), you gain experience.

Character Level:
     Your level depends on your experience.  This improves hitpoints and
(usually) spellpoints and most of the basic character abilities, and lets you
learn new spells and gain attributes.
     As you gain levels, your title changes to reflect your growing power.

Gold:
     Gold is amazingly handy, because the goods stores sell can 
be yours with enough of the stuff.  Characters start out with a set amount of 
gold determined.  
     Within the Mines of Moria lies more gold than you will ever find, more
seams of treasure than you will ever dig, and more monsters carrying loot than
you will ever kill.

Hitpoints:
     Your hitpoints are your life wrapped up in a number; if they ever drop
below zero, you die.  Resting will restore hitpoints, but you should always have
some quicker way to heal yourself on hand.  Your maximum hitpoints depends on
your level, race, and class, plus a constitution bonus (which can be
considerable).  You can also get an increase in your max hitpoints as a quest
reward.

Spellpoints:
     If you use magic, you will also have spellpoints, or mana.  Your maximum
mana depends on your level and your intelligence (if you are a mage,  
rogue, or ranger) and/or wisdom (if you are a priest or paladin).  
Ways to recover mana faster than by resting are rare and greatly desired.
     Mana goes down if you wear heavy armour.  Mages and rogues also
lose a chunk of mana if they wear most (but not all) kinds of gloves.

Armour Class:
     Armour class (AC) makes you harder to hit in melee, and reduces the damage
you take from many (but not all) monster blows.  You can raise it by equipping
more and better armour, by increasing your Dexterity, and by activating various
temporary effects.  As time passes, you will find this value rising past 100,
even to 150 and above at very high levels.

Score:
     Your score in Moria depends on how much experience you have earned and
how deep in the dungeon you have ventured.

Resistances:   
     Some spells, potions and other dungeon objects can temporarily give 
the player stronger resistance to the elemental attacks; fire, cold, acid, 
and electricity.  A line will show which temporary resistances the
player currently has.


***** <statistics>
--- Vital Statistics ---

     You have six primary statistics, or stats.  Each of them has important
effects, and how you juggle equipment to boost some stats at the expense of
others can greatly help or hinder your adventuring.  Deep in the dungeon,
potions exist that can permanently raise your stats.

Values for stats:
     Stats range from 3 to 18/100.  The progression of stats goes from 3 -> 17,
18, 18/10, 18/20 -> 18/100.  A value of 18/19 is the same as 18/10.
     The lowest any stat can go is 3, a level that greatly reduces any abilities
that stat influences.  The lowest "safe" figure for most stats is 7, but you
can't expect any significant bonuses until the stat reaches 18 or higher.  Once
you get a stat that high, further increases will greatly enhance your abilities,
eventually making it possible to slay some truly formidable monsters.  Stats max
out at 18/100.
     Stats depend on your internal stats, the equipment you are wearing, and
various temporary conditions.  The color of the stat becomes a darker green when 
sustained.


Strength:
     Increases in Strength increase melee damage and allow you to get more blows
with heavier weapons.  It improves both your melee and missile accuracy.
Strength also improves your tunneling ability, allows you to bear more weight
without being slowed down, and to wield heavier weapons effectively.

Intelligence:
     Intelligent characters use magic devices, pick locks, and disarm traps more
effectively.
     If you are using spells, intelligence is your primary stat.  It controls
how many spells you may learn, the amount of mana you have, and your spell
failure rate.  If you are using prayers, wisdom controls all of these things.


Wisdom:
     Wise characters have a better chance of resisting magical spells cast upon
them by monsters.  Wisdom is a priest or paladin's primary stat.

Dexterity:
     Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high dexterity may
allow you to get multiple blows with lighter weapons, and will increase your
chances of hitting with melee or missile weapons.  Dexterity is also useful in
picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves
that inhabit the dungeon.

Constitution:
     Constitution determines your ability to resist physical damage, and your
rate of recovery from poison, stuns, and cuts.  It makes a great difference to
the amount of hitpoints you have and the speed at which you recover them, and so
is a vital stat for any character.

Charisma:
     Charisma represents a character's ability to influence others.  A character
with a high charisma will receive better prices from store owners, whereas a
character with a very low charisma will be robbed blind.  Charisma also affects
the character's ability to use magic to sleep, stun, scare, or confuse a monster.


--- Abilities ---

     In addition to your stats, certain basic abilities define your character.
They depend on race, class, stats, and level, and may be powerfully influenced
by temporary conditions.  You can most effectively keep track of your abilities
by using the Character screen.

Saving Throw:
     The higher your saving throw, the more likely you are to resist the side
effects of monster blows and spells, traps, your own magic (when it fails), and
mental attacks.  Saving throw depends on race, class, wisdom, and level.

Stealth:
     The ability to move silently about is very useful.  If your stealth is good
enough, you can avoid fights, get in the first blow, and fight monsters one at a
time.  Stealth depends on race, class, and equipped items.

Fighting (Melee):
     The higher your melee ability, the more frequently you will hit in hand-to-
hand combat and the more critical hits you will get.  Your race, class, stats,
plusses to hit on equipped items (except for other weapons), and temporary
effects are all factored into the skill value displayed on your character
screen.  This also holds true for shooting ability.

Shooting:
     The higher your shooting ability, the more frequently you will hit with
missile weapons and the more critical hits you will get.

Disarming:
     The higher your disarming ability, the more quickly and safely you can pick
locks and disarm chests and traps.  Race, class, level, dexterity, and
intelligence all affect this ability.  

Magical Devices:
     Determines how likely you are to successfully use magical devices or
activatable items.  Race, class, level, and intelligence affect this ability.
You need considerable skill to use high-level objects.

Perception:
     The better your perception, the more likely it is that you will see traps
and secret doors automatically.  Perception depends on race, class, level, and
equipped objects.
     Note that this ability has no relationship to your ability to sense
(pseudo-ID) objects.

Searching:
     The better you are at searching, the more likely it is that you will see
traps and secret doors by searching for them.  Searching depends on race, class,
level, and equipped objects (same as perception).

Infra-vision:
     The higher your infravision, the further away you can see warm-blooded
creatures, even when invisible or not lit.


--- Conditions ---

     Your character may benefit or suffer from many different conditions.  The
most important ones are displayed on the bottom row of the main screen and the
lower part of the left panel.  

     Wounds    : Instead of recovering battle damage, you take additional damage
                 every turn.
     Stunning  : Your combat and spellcasting abilities decrease.  If you are
                 too badly stunned, you can be knocked out!
every so often), and finally starve (take
                 damage every turn).
     Blindness : You cannot see most monsters, it is harder to learn about
                 objects or what's around you, and get only vague information
                 when many things happen.  You often miss monsters, and cannot
                 cast spells or read scrolls.
     Confusion : You move and attack randomly and cannot cast spells, read
                 scrolls, or use magical devices, except for staves.
     Fear      : You cannot use melee combat.
     Poison    : Instead of recovering battle damage, you take additional damage
                 every turn.

State:
     You can sometimes be in one of several different states.

     Paralyzed : You cannot do ANYTHING until the effects wear off.
     Rest      : You are resting (double speed recovery of hitpoints and mana).
     Repeat    : You are repeating an action (like tunneling).
     Searching : You are searching (automatic search, but slowed speed).

Speed:
     The faster you are, the less time you take to perform all kinds of actions.
It is vital not to become too slow.  As you descend into the dungeon, you need
to find ways to hasten yourself temporarily and permanently.
     A speed of +1 is double speed ("fast"), and one of +2 is quadruple speed
("very fast").  A speed of -11 is half speed ("slow"), and one of -20 is one
quarter speed ("very slow").
     Permanent speed bonuses add to your base speed.  Temporary effects may
increase or reduce speed by 1.  

Depth:
     How deep in the dungeon you are.


Recall:
     There is an active word of recall that will send the player back to the town 
(if in the dungeon), or back down to the recall depth (if in the town).


State:
     Indicates if you are resting, repeating a command, or searching.

Cut:
     Indicates if you have a cut.  You will take damage every turn and this 
prevents you from healing (restoring ing your hp back to max health).  

Stun:  
     Indicates that you are stunned.  This affects your combat and spellcasting
ability.  If you are heavily stunned, you are close to being knocked out.  A 
knocked out character cannot move or attack, and are usually killed before they 
wake up.  It is important to heal as soon as possible if heavily stunned.

Hunger:
     You need to eat every so often.  If you eat too much, you become bloated 
and slow down.  If you eat too little, you become hungry (no special effects), 
weak (reduced recovery), feel faint (pass out).

Study:
     If you know magic, and can learn spells, you will see a "study" indicator
on the bottom row of the main screen.  If you have a book available, you can
learn the spells now.

Timed effects:
     Tells which temporary effects you are subject to.  Some are good, and some 
are bad.  The temporary effects are:  Hasting, slowing, blind, paralyzed, 
confused, afraid, hallucinating, poisoned, cut, stunned, protected from evil, 
invulnerability, heroic, super-heroic, shielded, blessed, see invisible, 
infravision, resisting the elements (acid, fire, cold, electricity), 
and flying.


Dtrap:
     The player is in an area where they have detected traps.  If the player 
is on the edge of the detect area, the text "DTrap" is yellow.
